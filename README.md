# Analytical Model For CSGO Player Head Position
This is based on my C++ implementaiton ([video demonstration](https://youtu.be/R3V5nBen-3U), [source code](https://github.com/David-Durst/csknow/blob/5d3906bbb232a09a2bbcff30d8f4c7f5d549f654/analytics/include/geometry.h#L188-L208)).

The C++ version has been tested. This version hasn't been thoroughly tested, but it's the same code (modulo C++/golang differences). I will test this (and update readme) when I need it for my research.
